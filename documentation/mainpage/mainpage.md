This documentation generated with Doxygen contains all the information required to be able to understand the variables,
definitions and functions provided to use this driver library in order to be able to implement the MLX90614 Infra Red
Thermometer Device in a desired application. This library was written in C programming language and it is meant to be
used in STMicroelectronics microcontrollers and microprocessors together with the libraries provided by that
manufacturer.

Feel free to review the other tabs of this offline documentation in order to learn more about the features of what this
library has to offer and any considerations that you might need to have in mind before considering to acquire and
implement a MLX90614 Device into your project.

Also, in the case that you are interested in contributing to this project, know that all the functions, variables and
definitions of the source file (i.e., the .c file) of this library are also documented with Doxygen syntax/format even
though that their documentation is not shown in this offline documentation version (only the documentation written at
the header file is shown).

On the other hand, for reaching out a code example for implementing this library, review the detailed description of the
MLX90614 Infra Red Thermometer Driver module at the provided offline documentation.

Last but not least, the configurations and details of the microcontroller used for testing and validating this library
can be reviewed at the
<a href=https://github.com/Mortrack/MLX90614_STM_driver/blob/main/documentation/pdfs/STM32CubeMX_configurations_report.pdf>STM32CubeMX_configurations_report.pdf</a>
file. In addition, feel free to also

for each pull-up resistors in that schematic. Finally, it is important to also highlight that the UART1 was used for the
printf() function of the stdio.h C library.

<i><b><u>NOTE:</u></b> To be able to link the printf() function to the UART1 as it was done during the testings and
validations made for this library, make sure to copy-paste/implement the following code into your main.c file:</i>

```c
/*@brief	Compiler definition to be able to use the @ref printf function from stdio.h library in order to print
 *          characters via the UART1 Peripheral but by using that @ref printf function.
 *
 * @return	The \p ch param.
